## Internationalization

Jobwizard has a special feature regarding internationalization. Normally, an 
application only considers the setting of a user. 

However, the Jobwizard allows the creation of job advertisements. Language 
settings for an advertisement can differ from the settings of the user.  Also, 
job ads can be multi-language. And then there are requirements about language
skills for an applicant.

Many things that have something to do with language.
