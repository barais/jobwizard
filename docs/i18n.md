## Internationalization

Jobwizard has a special feature regarding internationalization. Normally, an application only considers the setting of a user.

However, the Jobwizard allows the creation of job advertisements. Language
settings for an advertisement can differ from the settings of the user. Also, job ads can be multi-language. And then there are requirements about language skills for an applicant.

Many things that have something to do with language.

## Variable names

At the moment we write German and English translations in our vue files in an `<i18n></i18n>` block. This allows us to quickly develop new functions in multiple languages. But if we want to add more languages later, we need to manage translations more centrally. And to get there, we need to come up with clever naming for the placeholders.

We've done so in our settings pages.

```
<i18n>
  {
    "en": {
      "settings": {
        "misc_title": "Misc",
        "misc_layout": {
          "header": "Layout",
          "name": "Dark mode"
        },
        "misc_locale":{
          "header": "Locale",
          "name": "Locale"
        }
      }
    },
    "de": {
      "settings": {
        "misc_title": "Sonstiges",
        "misc_layout": {
          "header": "Ansicht",
          "name": "Nachtmodus",
        },
        "misc_locale":{
          "header": "Standort",
          "name": "Standort"
        }
      }
    }
  }
</i18n>
```
